'''FINDINGS

After analysing the data with 4 different Machine Learning models commonly used 
to perform data classification, it was found the most relevant factors that 
affect success are: Job and Credit in Default. 

For Job column, it was found that the campaigns were more effective among people
with these jobs/occupations: blue-collar, retired, and student

For the Default column, campaigns were more effective in people who did not have
credit in default.

Now, models used for this analysis, got prediction scores above a baseline 
calculated based on the proportion of the different categories, which in our case
those would be 'Yes' or No' (accepted).

Finally, in order to identify the most relevant characteristics that affect success
we utilized an encoding method that allowed us to turn each option within each column
into another column, in order to be able to calculate the level of relevance
 it has for the final output, based on its frequency of occurrence.

 Next Steps and Recommendations:

 In order to apply some filtering to the groups of people identified by their 
 job and credit default status, some more information be useful, like salary range,
 type of studies (e.,g., University, Highschool, etc), credit score, 
 number of credits, etc.

 As recommendation, using more thoughful categories, that are better defined 
 on clear differences, will improve a lot the inputs to the system and therefore
 the accuracy of the model.
